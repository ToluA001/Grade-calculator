# Grade-calculator
A Grade calculator that as two options. One calculating the the grade on a test or quiz, test grade calculator. The other being an average calculator.
The Grade clac is my first "big project" and I strated working on it as my final project of CSE 2022. 
I went version by version starting a new version everytime I wanted to add or change something, some changes are minute and others are quite drastic.
All versions are full documented and I did receive help from my cse partner Bryson up until v6 or so. 
I do one day hope to fully develope it has an app and publish it to the general public.
I'm not gonna lie it is kinda a mess as of when I'm writing thiis (6/12/22) but i hope to continue working and develping it. 
To see what the lastest version of the Grade Calc is go to the branch "Lastest Version".
